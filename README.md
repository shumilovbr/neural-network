# NN cutting

**Input:** The user has a NN that can recognize numbers from 0 to 9.

**Result:** The user is able to cut the NN into two NNs that able to recognize numbers from 0 to 4 and 5 to 9

**The Goal:**
- New NNs can do that without relearning or it takes a little processing capacity
- Reducing the number of neurons
- No descending in the quality of recognition
